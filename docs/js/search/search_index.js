multiple sockets are managed and recently compatibility with Nooie bulbs and Lifx white bulb has also been implemented.\nInstall\nJust clone repository, run npm install\nBuild\nrun npm run

device.\n\nTurn On multiple socket \nhttp://127.0.0.1:8081/tuya/multiple?id=&key=&use=accendi&subdevice=\nTurn On single socket \nhttp://127.0.0.1:8081/tuya/single?id=&key=&use=accendi\nTurn On nooie

bulbs).\nThe system exposes its api and all the options provided through the url http://127.0.0.1:8081/swagger which is available after the project has been started.\nYou can find project
