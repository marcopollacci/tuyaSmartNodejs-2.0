implementations\nInformation\nThe project born to have an http server to remotely manage the home automation sockets compatible with the Tuya and Smart Life apps.\nCurrently, single sockets and multiple sockets are managed and recently compatibility with Nooie bulbs and Lifx white bulb has also been implemented.\nInstall\nJust clone repository, run npm install\nBuild\nrun npm run build\nSupported Device\n\nBulb and Socker compatible with Tuya and SmartLife app\nNooie Bulb\nLifx Bulb (no color version)\n\nCall Example\nIn order to work, you need both the id and the key of the device.\n\nTurn On multiple socket \nhttp://127.0.0.1:8081/tuya/multiple?id=&key=&use=accendi&subdevice=\nTurn On single socket \nhttp://127.0.0.1:8081/tuya/single?id=&key=&use=accendi\nTurn On nooie

system exposes its api and all the options provided through the url http://127.0.0.1:8081/swagger which is available after the project has been started.\nYou can find project documentation schema
