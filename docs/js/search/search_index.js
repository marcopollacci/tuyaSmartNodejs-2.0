implementations\nInformation\nThe project born to have an http server to remotely manage the home automation sockets compatible with the Tuya and Smart Life apps.\nCurrently, single sockets and multiple sockets are managed and recently compatibility with Nooie bulbs has also been implemented.\nInstall\nJust clone repository, run npm install\nBuild\nrun npm run build\nCall Example\nIn order to work, you need both the id and the key of the device.\n\nTurn On multiple socket \nhttp://127.0.0.1:8081/tuya/multiple?id=&key=&use=accendi&subdevice=\nTurn On single socket \nhttp://127.0.0.1:8081/tuya/single?id=&key=&use=accendi\nTurn On nooie bulb\nhttp://127.0.0.1:8081/nooie?id=&key=&use=accendi\n\nFor each call, there are many options (especially for nooie bulbs).\nThe system exposes its api and all the options provided through the url http://127.0.0.1:8081/swagger which is available after the project has been started.\nPm2\nUse Pm2 with
